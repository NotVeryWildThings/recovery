            An interesting question was posed to me a few days ago by a dear friend, a question that I struggled to answer for myself.
            The question was asked amist a conversation about how we could better ourselves in the context of relationships.
            The question was: what are my core values? 
          </p>
          <p>
            At first I thought of the question in terms of what I wanted from a partner but I was wrong, as my dear friend later
            clarified that the core values I am to think of are my own. Upon overcoming this initial hurdle I quickly faced another.
            As I began pondering, my mind began circling around, trying to answer another question: what does value mean or
            more specifically what does value mean in the context of my life?
          </p>
          <p>
            A quick lookup of the definition of the word "value" yields "the importance, worth, or usefulness of something". "Ok" I
            unconvincingly said to myself, but how does one determine something is important or useful in their life? Is something
            important or useful in life because it makes life better or easier? Surely yes. Can something important or useful in life
            lose its impact through overexposure? Possibly. Is something important or useful in life something I need to live?
            Theoretically no.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why am I overthinking this? I'm entirely not sure. There is definitely something about the question that leaves me
            uncertain that I am going to answer this right but maybe that is the point :) Writing the thought process down did help
            navigating to an answer though.
          </p>
          <p>
            So here they are my dear friend. I, Gerald Truong, solemnly declare the following to be my core values as of June 2020:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Live life with the minimum amount of stress possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always have an open mind. There are no absolutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Always try. Always get back up.
            </li>
            <li>
              Be useful to your family, community and / or society.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is always better. There is always worse.
            </li>
            <li>
              Everything in moderation.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Cheers!
          </p>
