            20 days.
          </p>
          <p>
            It sure feels longer than that, not that it's a bad thing. At this point of my life
            I have a greater appreciation for the moments ahead, both expected and, to a greater
            extent, unexpected. The notion of a future feels like hope. Another day, another chance
            to right the wrongs, what an incredible gift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talking about gifts you, my friends and family, are the most wonderful gifts of them all.
            When all is said and done, at the end of each adventure, the best of them are always the
            ones in which I bonded with someone or nurtured an existing one. These bonds are what make
            me feel like a rich man in this world providing me with acceptance, self-worth and the
            purest of joys. I have resolved myself to emphasize this in all aspects of my social life
            and for that I feel unabashedly enlightened :)
          </p>
          <p>
            But truly this latest nugget of self-discovery feels like a major stepping stone in what
            I would define as my maturity. It is as if I developed a new brain muscle that pulls me back
            on the right path when my mind starts to wander off. It is reshaping my social landscape
            and fills it with exciting new opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            So here's to health and your company,
            And one for the lasses,
            Let's drink and be merry, all out of our glasses,
            Let's drink and be merry, bad thoughts to refrain,
            For we may or may not ever all be here again.
          </p>
          <p>
            RIP Tony.
