            Dear family and friends,
          </p>
          <p>
            After a little over a year and a half  of decadence
            I am now facing the reality that I have an addiction.
            Most of you who are reading this already know.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the beginning I thought I could find a way to control
            myself and say no when it was best to do so. Alas despite
            my best efforts to constrain myself, like taking on a part
            time job and having very little discretionary spending budget,
            I have failed again this past week.
          </p>
          <p>
            This “letter” which I am writing to you is a recovery
            technique I was told about. I plan on writing a letter
            everyday until recovery is achieved. This technique is 
            omewhat analogous to the “Don’t break the chain” technique
            made famous in part or whole by the Seinfeld TV show.
            It is also a way for me to concretize the problem, to
            make it a part of the reality outside of my mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            A lot of you recommended I go talk to someone or some
            kind of therapist. For reasons I could go into if I had
            more time but will eventually address, I always balk at
            the idea. Instead I attended an AA meeting in Burlingame
            this morning. As I walked through the door I was welcomed
            immediately without question. I took a seat between two older
            gentlemen: Ron and Donny who kindly smiled at me. During the
            meeting some of the attendees shared their achievements and
            others shared their grief. Sitting in a room where everyone
            was facing and some of them overcoming their own demon was
            incredibly warming. Despite some warnings that some of these
            meetings tend to sound like religious recruiting meetings
            this one was not the case. God was mentioned only 3 or 4 times,
            the last 2 times at the end of the meeting where we all held
            hands in a circle and said a prayer: Holy Father. Though I
            have recited this prayer over a 1000 times in my life during mass,
            this was by far the one that I recited the most wholeheartedly,
            partly for me but mostly for these souls at the meeting whose problems
            seemed much bigger than mine and showed incredible courage,
            to me at least, by sharing. I plan on going every week and like
            writing these “letters” use it to track my recovery. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Relatively speaking, my problem, which begins with the
            infamous white powdery substance, is easier to disconnect
            from than alcohol as it is not something available at every
            corner store near you. I only have 1 one connection to the
            powdery delight which delivers at the address of your choice
            in SF and Oakland from 2 to 4 in the afternoons and 8 to 10 in
            the evenings. Suffice to say the easy accessibility was a big
            factor in feeding my demon. As such I have removed all occurrences
            of my connection from my phone. It definitely took some research
            getting that number to completely disappear. Turns out clearing
            what the phone / messaging apps store is a function only found
            after digging through 4 or 5 layers of menus with unhelpful menu
            item names.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have asked myself why I had not done it sooner. My current
            hypothesis can be summed up in one word: pride. I prided
            myself with a work hard / play hard mentality and my play hard
            half wanted to allow itself an once in awhile indulgence and
            it always was accompanied with the false notion that I would
            have self control.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a different note I have begun to watch the Showtime’s dark
            comedy Patrick Melrose. Though I am nowhere close to the
            protagonist’s struggle the portrayal of his mental back and
            forth feels very familiar and makes the show interesting to watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is all for today folks. Thank you for reading. Godspeed.
