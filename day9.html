            The response from my first letter was more than I could ask
            for and my heart is still filled with gratitude. Thank you.
          </p>

            Though I have succeeded in my most critical endeavor I have failed in two.

            First there is the writing. Within 2 days I fully realized how overshot my
            aspirations were for writing these letters on a daily basis. It is with both
            regret and relief that I have adjusted the frequency of my literary output to
            weekly.

            Then there is the meeting. I decided to skip this past Saturday's in favor of
            spending time with Noah who was staying with me this weekend. In present hindsight
            it was time well spent, punctuated by what I hope were some father and son bonding
            moments. However tiny they may have been, I will take every single one of them.
            I know that the bond I form with Noah will be one of the sticks upon which I will
            measure myself once I draw my last breath.
