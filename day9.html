            The response from my first letter was more than I could ask
            for and my heart is still filled with gratitude. Thank you.
          </p>

            And these past 9 days felt really good. There were 2 days where I would have
            normally faltered. On Thursday I had a deliciously refreshing IPA at lunch
            and I was feeling really good about myself. Upon walking back to the office
            the void of responsibility began forming in my head. All the reasons why I should
            not play were being sucked into this black hole as soon as my mind would narrate
            them. And then it came. "Message him" it said. I shook my head with a smile.
            The knowledge of not having the number on hand provided instant relief and I was
            able to move on. The temptation did not come back until the following Saturday evening
            after enjoying copious amount of very tasty yet affordably priced roses and leaving a pool party
            around 10pm. This instance only lasted a mere 5 seconds though as the idea of laying on my
            bed relaxing quickly rose to the top as the more appealing scenario, and it was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though I have succeeded in my most critical endeavor I have failed in two.
          </p>
          <p>
            First there is the writing. Within 2 days I fully realized how overshot my
            aspirations were for writing these letters on a daily basis. It is with both
            regret and relief that I have adjusted the frequency of my literary output to
            weekly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then there is the meeting. I decided to skip this past Saturday's in favor of
            spending time with Noah who was staying with me this weekend. In present hindsight
            it was time well spent, punctuated by what I hope were some father and son bonding
            moments. However tiny they may have been, I will take every single one of them.
            I know that the bond I form with Noah will be one of the sticks upon which I will
            measure myself once I draw my last breath.

            Talking about fatherhood, I continue to watch Patrick Melrose and with whose protagonist
            I have found more commonalities. The struggles he shared with his parents and how they
            affect him as a parent and as a person I can relate to even though I can fortunately say
            I did not endure the same physical abuse. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On a last note, waking up to beautiful mornings in a town like Belmont is very conducive
            to feelings of hope and happiness. Not a bad place to be when one wants to get better.
            I recently stood at the train station and while waiting for the next train the following
            words flowed in between my ears:        
          </p>
          <p>
            <i>"Watching the clouds go by, feeling the wind gently washing your face,
            lit by a gigantic ball of fire burning in space. It feels like..."</i>
