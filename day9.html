            The response from my first letter was more than I could ask
            for and my heart is still filled with gratitude. Thank you.

            Though I have succeeded in my most critical endeavor I have failed in two:
            the writing and the meeting. I tried to write a letter the first couple of
            evenings but anything I could come up with was too short or uninteresting.
