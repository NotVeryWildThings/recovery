            An interesting question was posed to me a few days ago by a dear friend, a question that I struggled to answer for myself.
            The question was asked amist a conversation about how we could better ourselves in the context of relationships.
            The question was: what are my core values? 
          </p>
          <p>
            At first I thought of the question in terms of what I wanted from a partner but I was wrong, as my dear friend later
            clarified that the core values I am to think of are my own. Upon overcoming this initial hurdle I quickly faced another one.
            As I began pondering, my mind began circling around, trying to answer another question: what does value mean or
            more specifically what does value mean in the context of my life?
          </p>
          <p>
            A quick lookup of the definition of the word "value" yields "the importance, worth, or usefulness of something" but how does
            one determine something is important or useful in their life? Is it something you can feel or is it an educated guess?
